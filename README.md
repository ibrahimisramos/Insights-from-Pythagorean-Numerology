# Contextualizing Numerology's Pertinence to Personal Identity Construction in Singapore (NHS3901)
## Overview

As part of my Independent Study Module (ISM) in my Honours programme with an academic component, University Scholars Programme (USP), I chose to do a project on Numerology, particularly on Pythagorean Numerology as I was familiar with it. Born out of a conversation with my friend Dhameem who was skeptical when I said that I learnt numerology and it is quite accurate, I tested it on him and he was suprised that it was quite true. He suggested me to test it out on USP people and do it as my ISM, under my favourite Professor, Dr Mustafa Izzudin. Also awareness is low in Singapore so it would be interesting to explore its potential benefits in Singapore.
 
In total, I did readings for over 50 people through my study (22 official people) and for the community in general (for free) during our Collective Market event (Free market concept). The results show that the average rating for the different insights that can be generated is 7.3.

For the readings, I generated a customised Word Document report based on their full name (English) and date of birth using Python.

## Synopsis

In this paper, I have proposed how Pythagorean Numerology can be utilized as a tool to understand ourselves and construct one's personal identity. This is by unravelling our inborn characteristics such as how masculine or feminine we are, risk-taking capacity, our tendency to feel spirits, our natural talents and the values and characteristics we find important. Furthermore, it helps to contextualise the events surrounding us by providing some reasoning to the struggles we might face and the situations we might find ourselves. Thus I advocate for more to be done to increase visibility and adoption in Singapore.

## What is Pythagorean Numerology

Numerology is the study of numbers and builds upon the belief that there are numbers 
associated with us which define who we are as a person and these numbers have vibrations that 
affect us and the events that occur in the universe. 

Pythagorean Numerology, better known as western numerology, is derived during the time Pythagoreas was alive. Basically, from our full name and date of birth, we can get insights to ourselves of who we are, what we are good at and what lessons we are meant to learn in this lifetime. 


As a pseudoscience, underlying Numerology is the idea of reincarnation whereby we are born multiple times and before we are sent onto the earth, our souls have a soul contract attached to it with the lessons to be learnt over their lifetime here. 


## Argument/Findings from project

Numerology is useful in constructing our personal identity by providing insights to:

- Characteristics that define us
    - Masculinity
    - Risk-taking propensity
    - Tendency to feel spirits
    - Natural talents
    - Values and Characteristics we find important
- Life events that shape us
    - The events that occur in their life
    - Struggles we face
    - The situations we find ourselves in/gravitate towards due to the lessons we need to learn
